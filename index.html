<h2>OVERVIEW</h2> 
<h2>DAY 1</h2>
<h3>Introduction to The Money Hub</h3>
<p>The Money Hub is a financial education startup with the mission of making learning financial literacy simple, applicable and fun. We were founded as a result of the lived experience of our founder Mohammed Faisal who growing up as a low income immigrant kid in NYC witnessed a lack of high quality financial education. He knew then as he knew in 2016 when he founded the Money Hub that he wanted to help solve this problem especially for the kids. #doitforthekeeeds
Since 2016 weve served over 10k scholars of low income background citywide. During this span weve also learned from our scholars in ways to engage them creating our pillars of simplification, gamification, competition, reward, community and fun!

<H2>DAY 2</H2>

<h4>Handout construction paper, go over what a vision board is, then work on activity</h4>
<h2>VISION BOARD ACTIVITY</h2>
<p>In this activity, students will each create their own vision board. A vision board is a collage of words and images that demonstrate what future success looks and feels like for the person completing it. The words and images on the board represent goals and aspirations meant to remind individuals what their future can be if they attain those goals and thus motivate them to do so.</p>

<ol>INSTRUCTIONS
<li>Explain the concept of a vision board to students and how they can create one.</li>
<li>Provide students with examples of vision boards and the time to create their own. Ensure that enough time remains for each student to present their vision board.</li>
<li>After each student has completed their vision boards, allow each student the opportunity to present their vision board. Each student may choose to allow comments from the group.
Ask each student to either post their vision board in the classroom for the duration of the program or bring the board home and post it somewhere visible to act as motivation for them to meet their goals. If students post their boards in the classroom, explain that they may bring the boards home with them whenever they choose. Students may edit their vision boards at any point in the future.</li></ol>

<h2>WHAT IS A VISION BOARD AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<a href="https://atozenlife.com/vision-board-ideas/">10 POWERFUL VISION BOARD IDEAS</a>
<p>A vision board is a collection of images, words, quotes, objects, and ideas that help you visualize your goals and achieve your dreams by harnessing the Law of Attraction.
It is basically a visual representation of where you hope to be in the future and what you hope to be doing there.
By putting your board in a visible location and looking at it daily you focus your positive energy on making the things on your board a reality!
BASIC TYPES OF VISION BOARDS
Like I mentioned before, the only limit to what you can create is often your own imagination!
However, most vision boards fall under these basic categories:
Collages (on posterboard, corkboard, or even framed)
Digital boards (on your computer, phone, or Pinterest)
Bullet journals
Dream walls
Metal or string grids</p>
